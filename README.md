# ðŸ§© Wireframing in the Design Process

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the layout, structure, and functionality of a user interface without focusing on colors, images, or detailed design elements.

Wireframes are essential in the early stages of product design because they help teams visualize the structure of a page or screen before any actual development begins.

## Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing plays a crucial role in modern software and product design. It enables:

- **Fast Iteration:** Quickly test layout ideas before investing in visual design.
- **Clear Communication:** Serves as a visual blueprint to align developers, designers, and stakeholders.
- **Usability Testing:** Helps identify navigation and functionality issues early.
- **Requirement Clarity:** Ensures all necessary elements are accounted for before moving to high-fidelity prototypes.

- The **ideation** phase to explore design solutions.
- The **requirement analysis** phase to visualize client needs.
- **User testing** to validate structure before styling.
